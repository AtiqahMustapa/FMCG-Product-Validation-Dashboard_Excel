# FMCG Data Validation & Dashboard Automation (Mini Project)

This project simulates a **retail data operations workflow** processes.  
It demonstrates data cleaning, category mapping, anomaly detection, dashboarding, and VBA automation.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
- Built a synthetic FMCG dataset (50 products, 200 sales transactions).
- Validated **RawSales** against **Products_Master** using Excel formulas.
- Flagged anomalies such as **missing barcodes (MasterExists), price variances (PriceVarianceFlag), and mis-coded products (CodingStatus)**.
- Designed a **Dashboard** with PivotTables & PivotCharts (Sales by Category, Quantity by Category, Category Share, Top 10 SKUs).
- Created **KPI cards** (Data Reliability %, Number of Anomalies, % Missing SKUs) as quick health checks.
- Automated workflow with **VBA macro** to refresh data and export the Dashboard as a PDF.
